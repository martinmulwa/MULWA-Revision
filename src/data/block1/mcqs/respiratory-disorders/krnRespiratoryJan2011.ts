        C: "500ml",
        D: "150ml"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "500ml (C) is correct because tidal volume is the volume of air moved in or out during a quiet, normal breath, about 6 to 8 mL per kg, which is roughly 500 mL in a healthy 70 kg adult. 1000ml (A) is incorrect because 1000 mL is about twice a normal breath and is closer to what is taken in during a deep breath. 1200ml (B) is incorrect because 1200 mL is close to the residual volume, the air that stays in the lungs after a maximal breath out. 150ml (D) is incorrect because 150 mL is close to the anatomical dead space, the air in the airways that does not reach the alveoli.",

        C: "Shows no communicating cavity with the chest wall",
        D: "Has increased friction with the chest wall during inhalation"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Displaced and compresses the aorta and the heart (A) is correct because air enters the pleural space through a one-way valve and cannot escape, so pressure builds up, the lung collapses and the mediastinum, including the heart and great vessels, is pushed over and compressed, which lowers venous return and cardiac output. Strictly it is the mediastinum that is displaced, but this is the only option that describes the pressure effect. Enlarges to occupy large space in the chest cavity (B) is incorrect because the affected lung collapses; it does not enlarge. Shows no communicating cavity with the chest wall (C) is incorrect because in tension pneumothorax there is a communication (through the lung or chest wall) that lets air into the pleural space; a closed, non-communicating cavity does not produce rising tension. Has increased friction with the chest wall during inhalation (D) is incorrect because friction is increased in pleurisy; in pneumothorax air separates the pleural layers so they no longer rub.",

        D: "Start the patient with intravenous dexamethasone and intravenous terbutaline."
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Administer hydrocortisone intravenously and nebulizer with ventolin. (C) is correct because acute asthma needs a rapid-acting bronchodilator (nebulised salbutamol, also called Ventolin) together with a systemic corticosteroid such as intravenous hydrocortisone to settle the airway inflammation. Administer oxygen via Venturi mask (A) is incorrect because oxygen is given to correct hypoxaemia, and a saturation above 95% does not need it. Nebulizer with hydrocortisone and salbutamol. (B) is incorrect because hydrocortisone is a systemic steroid given by injection or orally; it is not given by nebuliser. Start the patient with intravenous dexamethasone and intravenous terbutaline. (D) is incorrect because intravenous terbutaline and dexamethasone are escalation measures for severe or non-responding attacks, not first-line care for a patient who is well saturated.",

        D: "Emphysema"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Emphysema (D) is correct because emphysema destroys the alveolar walls and the capillary bed around them, which reduces the surface for gas exchange and removes elastic recoil, so air is trapped and the chest becomes barrel-shaped. Asthma (A) is incorrect because asthma is reversible airway narrowing from inflammation, oedema and bronchospasm, without destruction of alveoli. Bronchiectasis (B) is incorrect because bronchiectasis is permanent widening of the bronchi with chronic infection, not destruction of alveolar walls. Chronic bronchitis (C) is incorrect because chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi with mucus gland enlargement and a chronic productive cough; the alveolar walls are not primarily destroyed.",

      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Crackles (A) is correct because crackles are short, explosive, discontinuous sounds produced when small airways pop open or when fluid and secretions are moved in the airways. Wheezes (B) is incorrect because wheezes are continuous, musical sounds caused by narrowed airways. Stridor (C) is incorrect because stridor is a continuous, harsh, high-pitched sound heard mainly on inspiration over the upper airway. Shrills (D) is incorrect because shrills is not a standard adventitious breath sound; high-pitched sounds such as wheeze and stridor are continuous, not discontinuous.",

        D: "Prevent the affected lung bleeding"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Re-expand the collapsed lung and initiate breathing (C) is correct because atelectasis is collapse of lung tissue, so the main aim is to reopen the collapsed alveoli and re-expand the lung with measures such as deep breathing, incentive spirometry, coughing and positioning. Drain excess pleural fluid by tapping (A) is incorrect because tapping (thoracentesis) removes pleural fluid and is used for pleural effusion, not as the main goal in atelectasis. Prevent complications that are likely to develop (B) is incorrect because preventing complications such as pneumonia is a supporting aim, but the main goal is to restore lung expansion. Prevent the affected lung bleeding (D) is incorrect because bleeding is not a feature of atelectasis, so preventing it is not a treatment goal.",

        D: "Hypertension, bacterial parapneumonia"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Tuberculosis, bacterial parapneumonia (A) is correct because tuberculosis and infection beside a bacterial pneumonia (parapneumonic involvement of the pleura) are among the commonest causes of pleural inflammation in adults, especially in Kenya where TB is common. Systemic larva migrants of nematodes, chronic bronchitis (B) is incorrect because larval migration by nematodes and chronic bronchitis are not common causes of pleuritis. Bacterial parapneumonia,drug toxicity (C) is incorrect because bacterial parapneumonia is a cause, but drug-induced pleuritis is uncommon, so the pair is not the commonest causes. Hypertension, bacterial parapneumonia (D) is incorrect because hypertension does not cause pleuritis, even though parapneumonia does.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "is in situ (A) is correct because stage 1 is the earliest, localised stage, where the tumour is confined to the lung without lymph node spread; of the four options, this is the one that describes a localised tumour. (Strictly, carcinoma in situ is stage 0.) Has spread to mediastinal lymph nodes (B) is incorrect because spread to mediastinal lymph nodes is a later, locally advanced stage. Has metastasized to adjacent structures and organs (C) is incorrect because invasion of adjacent structures and organs is a locally advanced stage, not stage 1. Has spread to distal part of the body outside the chest cavity (D) is incorrect because spread outside the chest to distant organs is metastatic disease, the last stage.",

        D: "Positioning the patient in Fowler's position"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Positioning the patient in Fowler's position (D) is correct because sitting the patient upright in Fowler's position lets the diaphragm move freely, expands the lungs and makes it easier to cough up secretions, so it is the first and safest measure. Encourage the patient to cough very hard (A) is incorrect because forceful coughing tires the patient, can cause bronchospasm and is less effective than controlled, supported coughing. Administer an antitussive (B) is incorrect because an antitussive suppresses the cough and so leaves secretions in the airway. Administer an analgesic (C) is incorrect because an analgesic may help with pain that limits coughing, but it can depress breathing and is not the priority.",

        C: "Prepare a chest tube insertion tray",
        D: "Position on the unaffected side"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Apply dressing on the wound (B) is correct because a sucking chest wound lets air be drawn into the pleural space with each breath, so the first action is to seal the wound at once with an occlusive dressing, usually taped on three sides so that trapped air can escape. Administer oxygen via mask (A) is incorrect because oxygen is needed, but it comes after the wound is sealed because air keeps entering the chest until then. Prepare a chest tube insertion tray (C) is incorrect because a chest tube is inserted by the doctor after the wound is sealed; preparing the tray is a later step. Position on the unaffected side (D) is incorrect because positioning does not stop air entering the chest; the patient is positioned for comfort and breathing after the dressing is applied.",

        D: "Pleurisy, lung cancer"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Lung abscess, Bronchiectasis (B) is correct because lung abscess that does not respond to treatment and bronchiectasis with a badly damaged lung are both accepted reasons for removing lung tissue; lung cancer, TB with a destroyed lung and fungal disease are other indications. Aspergillum, Bronchiectasis (A) is incorrect because Aspergillum is not a disease name (it may mean aspergilloma, a fungal ball, which is usually treated by removing a lobe or segment); the pair is less suitable than lung abscess with bronchiectasis. Atelectasis, emphysema (C) is incorrect because atelectasis is treated by re-expansion, and emphysema is a diffuse disease that is managed medically; neither is a usual reason for pneumonectomy. Pleurisy, lung cancer (D) is incorrect because pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura treated medically, so this pair is not made up of indications even though lung cancer is.",

      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Deoxygenated, with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide content (D) is correct because the pulmonary arteries carry blood returned from the tissues, which has given up oxygen and picked up carbon dioxide, to the alveolar capillaries to be reloaded. Oxygen-rich blood returning from the left atrium (A) is incorrect because oxygen-rich blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. Blood with oxygen and carbon dioxide equal to alveolar air (B) is incorrect because the blood has a lower oxygen and a higher carbon dioxide pressure than alveolar air, which is why gases move. Blood that mixes directly with inhaled air before the capillaries (C) is incorrect because blood never mixes with air; the two are separated by the respiratory membrane.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Alveolar oxygen pressure is higher than the pressure in the blood (A) is correct because gases diffuse down their partial pressure gradient; alveolar oxygen is at about 105 mmHg against about 40 mmHg in the arriving blood, and this steep gradient across the thin respiratory membrane drives oxygen rapidly into the blood. Haemoglobin pumps it across the membrane using ATP (B) is incorrect because oxygen crosses by passive diffusion; no energy-using pump is involved. Capillary blood pressure pushes it out into the alveolus (C) is incorrect because that would send gas in the wrong direction; the movement is driven by partial pressures, not blood pressure. Blood oxygen pressure is higher than oxygen pressure in the alveolar air (D) is incorrect because the opposite is true; blood arriving at the alveoli is low in oxygen.",

      explanation: "It diffuses from the blood into the alveolus and is exhaled (C) is correct because carbon dioxide is at a slightly higher pressure in the capillary blood (about 45 mmHg) than in the alveolar air (about 40 mmHg), so it passes into the alveolus and leaves the body in the exhaled breath. It diffuses from alveolar air into the blood to be carried to the tissues (A) is incorrect because this is the direction taken by oxygen, not carbon dioxide. It is carried across the membrane by pumps against its gradient (B) is incorrect because carbon dioxide crosses passively; no pump is needed.

A thick muscular wall that pumps gases across (A) is incorrect because the membrane has no muscle; gases cross by diffusion. A layer of cartilage that keeps the alveoli open (C) is incorrect because cartilage supports the larger airways, not the alveoli, and would slow diffusion.

      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Empyema (A) is correct because empyema is pus in the pleural space, and it usually requires drainage, as do large or complicated pleural effusions, because antibiotics alone cannot clear it. Emphysema (B) is incorrect because emphysema is destruction of alveoli inside the lung, not a pleural collection of pus. Atelectasis (C) is incorrect because atelectasis is collapse of lung tissue and is treated by re-expansion measures. Bronchiectasis (D) is incorrect because bronchiectasis is widening of the bronchi and is not drained through the pleura.",

Flat on the back, to prevent the tube from moving (A) is incorrect because lying flat reduces lung expansion and drainage.

Above chest level, so that gravity pushes air out (A) is incorrect because a raised unit allows fluid to run back into the pleural space. Level with the insertion site, carried by the patient (B) is incorrect because a unit at this height does not drain well and may be tipped.

Clamp the tube and wait for the doctor (B) is incorrect because a long clamp period can cause tension pneumothorax if air is leaking.

      explanation: "Cover the site with sterile petroleum gauze and call help (B) is correct because an airtight dressing at the site, applied right away, stops air entering the pleural space; the doctor is called and the patient is watched for breathing difficulty while reinsertion is prepared. Push the tube back in using sterile gloves (A) is incorrect because reinsertion is done by a trained doctor.

Normal tidaling that shows the system is working (A) is incorrect because tidaling is a rise and fall with breathing, not continuous bubbling.
