        D: "Right lung"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Right bronchus (B) is correct because the right main bronchus is wider, shorter and more vertical (about 25 degrees from the midline) than the left, so inhaled foreign bodies, vomitus and secretions fall straight into it. Left bronchus (A) is incorrect because it is longer, narrower and branches off at a sharper angle (about 45 degrees), making it a less direct path. Left lung (C) and Right lung (D) are incorrect because the question asks for the airway where the object first lodges; the object lodges in a bronchus, not in the lung tissue itself. Clinical link: this is why aspiration pneumonia most often affects the right lower lobe.",

        C: "Barrel chest",
        D: "Funnel chest"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Barrel chest (C) is correct because chronic air trapping (as in emphysema/COPD) keeps the lungs over-inflated, so the anteroposterior (front-to-back) diameter becomes equal to or greater than the lateral diameter and the chest looks barrel-shaped. Pigeon chest (A), also called pectus carinatum, is a forward protrusion of the sternum, usually from childhood rickets or congenital causes, not from lung over-inflation. Kyphoscoliosis (B) is a combined forward and sideways curvature of the spine. Funnel chest (D), or pectus excavatum, is a sunken sternum.",

        D: "Metabolic alkalosis"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Respiratory acidosis (B) is correct. Step 1: pH 7.25 is below 7.35, so it is acidosis. Step 2: PaCO2 58 mmHg is above 45 mmHg, meaning CO2 is retained (hypoventilation), and CO2 behaves as an acid, so the cause is respiratory. Step 3: HCO3 24 mEq/L is normal (22 to 26), so the kidneys have not yet compensated, which means the problem is acute and uncompensated. The PaO2 of 70 mmHg is also mildly low (normal 80 to 100). Respiratory alkalosis (A) would have a high pH and low PaCO2. Metabolic acidosis (C) would have a low pH with a low HCO3. Metabolic alkalosis (D) would have a high pH with a high HCO3.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Clubbing of fingers (D) is correct because clubbing (loss of the nail-bed angle with bulbous fingertips) develops slowly over weeks to months from long-standing hypoxia, so it points to chronic conditions such as bronchiectasis, lung cancer, lung abscess, and fibrosis. Central cyanosis (A) can occur in acute severe hypoxia (for example acute pneumonia or an acute asthma attack) and is therefore not specific to chronic disease. Orthopnea (B) is breathlessness on lying flat and occurs in acute or chronic heart failure and acute respiratory problems alike. Inspiratory stridor (C) is a high-pitched sound of acute upper-airway obstruction (for example foreign body, croup, laryngeal oedema), which is an emergency, not a chronic sign.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Orthopnea (B) is correct because it is the term for difficulty breathing when lying flat that is relieved by sitting up; it is often quantified by the number of pillows needed. Dyspnea (A) is the general term for shortness of breath in any position. Apnea (C) means complete absence of breathing. Bradypnea (D) is an abnormally slow respiratory rate (below 12 breaths per minute).",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Thoracentesis (C) is correct because it is the procedure in which a needle is passed through the chest wall into the pleural space to withdraw pleural fluid for laboratory analysis (diagnostic) or to relieve breathlessness (therapeutic). Thoracoscopy (A) is the direct visualisation of the pleural space with an endoscope. Needle biopsy (B) removes a piece of pleural tissue, not fluid. Thoracotomy (D) is a major surgical incision into the chest wall.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Pulmonary edema (A) is correct because fluid overload raises pulmonary capillary pressure and forces fluid into the alveoli. The result is sudden severe breathlessness, agitation and the classic frothy, pink-tinged sputum (fluid mixed with air and a little blood). Acute bronchitis (B) causes a productive cough with fever after a viral infection, not frothy pink sputum. Pleurisy (C) causes sharp pleuritic chest pain on breathing. Pleural effusion (D) develops more slowly and gives dullness to percussion and reduced breath sounds, without frothy pink sputum.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "3 months in 2 consecutive years (D) is correct. This is the standard clinical definition: a productive cough on most days for at least 3 months in each of 2 successive years, with other causes of chronic cough excluded. The other options are too short in duration or too few in years to meet the definition.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Albuterol (C), also called salbutamol, is correct because it is a short-acting beta-2 agonist (reliever) that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle within minutes. Prednisone (A) is a systemic corticosteroid that reduces inflammation but takes hours to work. Montelukast (B) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used for long-term control, not rescue. Cromolyn (D) is a mast cell stabiliser used to prevent attacks and is useless once an attack has started.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Smoking cessation slows down the decline in pulmonary function (B) is correct: stopping smoking is the single most effective intervention to slow the yearly loss of lung function (FEV1) in COPD. Option A is false because the airflow limitation in COPD is progressive and NOT fully reversible (full reversibility is a feature of asthma). Option C is false because COPD causes pulmonary hypertension and hypertrophy of the RIGHT side of the heart (cor pulmonale), not the left. Option D describes findings that appear only in advanced or acute-on-chronic COPD and is not true of every patient, so it is not the best statement.",

        C: "Do not move",
        D: "Move outwards and downwards"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Move inwards and downwards (A) is correct because a flail segment (two or more adjacent ribs each broken in two or more places) is no longer attached to the rest of the chest wall. During inspiration the intrathoracic pressure becomes negative, the normal chest wall expands outward, but the free segment is sucked inward. On expiration it bulges outward. This opposite (paradoxical) movement reduces ventilation and causes hypoxia. The other options describe normal chest wall movement or no movement, which is not what happens in flail chest.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Respiratory failure (B) is correct. Wheezing needs some air movement through narrowed airways. When the airways are almost completely blocked by bronchospasm, oedema and mucus plugs, so little air moves that the wheeze disappears (the silent chest). Together with exhaustion and drowsiness, this is an ominous sign and needs immediate emergency care. Right sided heart failure (A) is a slow complication of chronic lung disease. Pneumonia (C) is an infection and does not explain the loss of wheeze. Pneumothorax (D) is a possible complication, but a silent chest in status asthmaticus is classically a warning of respiratory failure.",

        D: "Check the drainage system for an air leak"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Check the drainage system for an air leak (D) is correct because continuous bubbling in the water seal chamber means air is constantly entering the system, either from a leak in the tubing, connections, or dressing, or from a persistent air leak in the lung. The nurse should check all connections and the insertion site and notify the doctor if it persists. Reposition because of kinking (A) is wrong because a kink would stop drainage and bubbling, not cause it. Continue to monitor only (B) is wrong because continuous bubbling is abnormal and needs action. Increase the suction (C) is wrong because it does not fix the leak and can damage lung tissue.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Trauma patient on mechanical ventilation (A) is correct because the endotracheal tube bypasses the natural defences of the upper airway, impairs cough and secretion clearance, and allows bacteria to enter the lungs, causing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Being hospitalised at age 45 to 50 (B) is not by itself a risk factor. Blunt chest trauma (C) raises risk mainly through pulmonary contusion and poor coughing, but the intubated patient has the strongest, most direct risk. Lack of pneumococcal vaccine (D) is too general, since many unvaccinated people never develop pneumonia.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Administer oxygen as prescribed to correct the low saturation (A) is correct because airway, breathing and circulation come first: a saturation of 89% means hypoxaemia that can quickly become life-threatening, so oxygen (usually titrated to keep saturation at about 93 to 95%) is given immediately together with the prescribed reliever drug. Oral fluids (B) support hydration but are not urgent and are unsafe while she is struggling to breathe.

      explanation: "Upright in high Fowler's position, leaning slightly forward (C) is correct because sitting upright lets the diaphragm move down freely and the lungs expand fully, and leaning forward (often resting arms on an overbed table, the tripod position) lets the accessory muscles of breathing work better, which lessens the work of breathing. Supine (A) and prone (B) positions press the abdominal contents against the diaphragm and restrict chest expansion.

Reducing mucus production (A) is not its main action. Blocking histamine release from mast cells (C) describes cromolyn, a preventer drug that is useless in an acute attack.

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "To reduce airway inflammation and swelling and prevent the attack from returning (D) is correct because the airway narrowing in asthma is caused partly by inflamed, oedematous mucosa. Corticosteroids suppress this inflammation, speed recovery and reduce relapse, but they take several hours to act, so they are given early alongside (not instead of) the fast-acting bronchodilator. Relaxing bronchial muscle within seconds (A) is the job of the bronchodilator. Thinning secretions (B) is achieved with hydration and humidified oxygen. Stimulating the respiratory centre (C) is not an action of corticosteroids.",

        D: "A sign of a healed pleural cavity"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Subcutaneous emphysema, which should be reported to the doctor (A) is correct because the crackling (crepitus) is caused by air leaking from the pleural space or lung into the tissue under the skin, often due to a blocked or displaced drain or a persistent air leak. The nurse should mark the area, check the tubing and connections for kinks, a blockage or leaks, monitor breathing and report promptly. It is not normal healing (B). A bottle that is too low (C) does not cause it. A healed pleural cavity (D) would not cause air under the skin.",

        A: "Clamp the tubing for the rest of the shift and wait for the doctor",
        B: "Pull out the chest drain immediately",
        C: "Place the open end of the chest tube into a container of sterile water and call for help",
        D: "Wipe the end with a dry gauze and reconnect it"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Place the open end of the chest tube into a container of sterile water and call for help (C) is correct because submerging the tube about 2 to 4 cm under sterile water re-creates an emergency water seal, so air can leave the pleural space but cannot be sucked in. The nurse then reports to the doctor, assesses breathing, and replaces the connection or system using aseptic technique. Clamping for a long period (A) risks tension pneumothorax. Pulling out the drain (B) is unsafe and is only done on the doctor's order. Reconnecting after a dry wipe (D) risks infection and entry of air.",

        A: "Leave the dressing untouched for a week even when it is soiled",

        D: "Allow the patient to dress the site themselves"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Inspect the site regularly and change the airtight sterile dressing aseptically when soiled or when due (B) is correct because the drain provides a direct route for bacteria into the pleural space and can cause empyema. Using aseptic technique, the nurse cleans the site, applies a sterile occlusive airtight dressing, secures the tube to the chest wall, and observes for redness, swelling, pus, and pain. A soiled dressing left in place (A) harbours bacteria. An open wound washed with tap water (C) is unsterile and allows air in. A patient doing their own dressing (D) lacks sterile technique and training.",
