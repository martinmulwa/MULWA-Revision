      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, alveoli (B) is correct because inhaled air passes from the nasal cavity to the pharynx (throat), then through the larynx (voice box and the entrance to the airway), down the trachea (windpipe), into the main bronchi and their branches, and finally into the alveoli where gas exchange occurs. Nose, trachea, pharynx, larynx (A) places the trachea too early. Nose, larynx, pharynx, trachea (C) reverses the pharynx and larynx. Nose, pharynx, trachea, larynx (D) places the larynx below the trachea, but the larynx lies above it. Clinical link: this order is the route followed when passing a suction catheter or an endotracheal tube.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Cyanosis (C) is correct because it is the bluish discolouration of the skin, lips, nail beds or mucous membranes caused by an increased amount of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the blood, which signals hypoxaemia. Erythema (A) is redness of the skin from increased blood flow, for example in inflammation. Jaundice (B) is a yellow discolouration of the skin and eyes caused by raised bilirubin. Clubbing (D) is a change in the shape of the fingertips and nails (loss of the nail-bed angle) that develops slowly in chronic hypoxia, and it is not a colour change.",

        C: "Respiratory alkalosis",
        D: "Respiratory acidosis"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Respiratory acidosis (D) is correct. Step 1: a pH of 7.26 is below 7.35, so the blood is acidic. Step 2: a PaCO2 of 72 mmHg is well above the normal 35 to 45 mmHg, so carbon dioxide (an acid) is being retained through hypoventilation, which makes the cause respiratory. Step 3: the HCO3 of 26 mEq/L is at the upper limit of normal (22 to 26), so the kidneys have not yet compensated, meaning the problem is acute. Metabolic acidosis (A) would show a low pH with a low HCO3. Metabolic alkalosis (B) would show a high pH with a high HCO3. Respiratory alkalosis (C) would show a high pH with a low PaCO2.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Viral infection (C) is correct because most cases of acute bronchitis follow a viral upper respiratory infection (for example influenza, rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus), which inflames the lining of the bronchi and causes a cough with or without sputum. Bacterial infection (A) is a less common cause, which is why antibiotics are usually not needed. Allergies (B) cause allergic airway conditions such as asthma, not typical acute bronchitis. Smoking (D) is the main cause of chronic bronchitis, not the acute form, although it makes acute attacks more likely.",

        D: "A viral infection lasting for two weeks"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "A persistent cough for at least 3 months in 2 consecutive years (B) is correct because this is the standard clinical definition: a productive cough on most days for at least 3 months in each of 2 successive years, with other causes of chronic cough excluded. A sore throat caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (A) describes streptococcal pharyngitis. Shortness of breath at night (C) describes paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, which is typical of heart failure. A viral infection lasting two weeks (D) describes an acute self-limiting infection, not a chronic disease.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Expiratory wheeze (A) is correct because narrowing of the airways from bronchospasm, mucosal swelling and mucus is worse on breathing out, producing a high-pitched whistling sound on expiration. Inspiratory crackles (B) are typical of pneumonia, pulmonary oedema and fibrosis. A decreased respiratory rate (C) is not expected, because the patient breathes faster (tachypnoea) in an attack. Diminished breath sounds throughout (D) can occur in a severe attack, the silent chest, but this is an ominous late sign and not the classic sign.",

        D: "Increased breath sounds"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Dullness on percussion (C) is correct because fluid in the pleural space replaces air and gives a dull, stony note when tapped, along with reduced breath sounds and reduced tactile fremitus over the fluid. Increased tactile fremitus (A) occurs over consolidated lung, as in pneumonia, whereas fluid dampens vibrations. Hyperresonance (B) is found when there is excess air, as in pneumothorax or emphysema. Increased breath sounds (D) occur over consolidation, whereas a large effusion reduces them.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Hospital acquired pneumonia (B) is correct because it is pneumonia that begins 48 hours or more after admission and was not incubating on arrival. This patient has been in hospital for 72 hours and has developed fever and crackles in the right lower lobe. Community acquired pneumonia (A) starts outside hospital or within the first 48 hours. Pneumonia in an immunosuppressed person (C) needs a cause such as advanced HIV or chemotherapy, which is not given. Aspiration pneumonia (D) needs a history of inhaling vomit or secretions, which is not described.",

        D: "Verifying the drainage system is below the client's chest"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Stripping the chest tube from the insertion site downwards (A) is correct because stripping or milking creates very high negative pressure in the pleural space that can damage lung or surgical tissue, so it is not done routinely and never without an order, and the nurse must stop the student. Keeping the tubing as straight as possible (B) prevents kinks and dependent loops and is correct practice. Assessing for gentle bubbling in the water seal chamber (C) is part of routine assessment, because gentle intermittent bubbling can be expected while air leaves the pleural space. Verifying that the drainage system is below the chest (D) is correct, because gravity drains the pleural space and prevents backflow.",

        C: "Ensure provision of extra blankets",
        D: "Encourage active ambulation in the next 24 hours"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Ensure return of the gag reflex before offering foods or drinks (B) is correct because the throat is numbed with topical anaesthetic for bronchoscopy, so the gag and cough reflexes are temporarily lost (usually for 1 to 2 hours) and food or fluid could be aspirated into the lungs. The nurse keeps the patient nil by mouth until the reflex has returned. Encouraging more fluids (A) is only appropriate after the reflex returns. Extra blankets (C) are not a priority. Active ambulation (D) is not encouraged, because the patient is expected to rest after sedation.",

        D: "Fracture of three adjacent ribs at two or more sites"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Fracture of three adjacent ribs at two or more sites (D) is correct because this breaks a segment of the chest wall free so that it moves paradoxically (inward on inspiration and outward on expiration), which reduces ventilation. Fracture of two ribs on one side (A) is a simple rib fracture, because there is no free segment. A single rib fracture with pneumothorax (B) is a rib fracture with a lung complication, and not a flail segment. Fracture of the sternum with haemothorax (C) is a different chest injury. Note that some textbooks accept two or more adjacent ribs, but three is the commonly taught definition.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "High Fowler's position with legs dangling down (B) is correct because these signs point to acute pulmonary oedema. Sitting upright lets the diaphragm descend and the lungs expand, and letting the legs hang pools blood in the legs, which reduces the blood returning to the heart (preload) and eases lung congestion. Supine with legs elevated (A) increases venous return and worsens breathlessness. Trendelenburg (C) pushes abdominal organs against the diaphragm and also increases venous return. Left lateral recumbent (D) does not relieve orthopnoea or reduce preload.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Patients usually have a history of early allergic conditions (D) is correct because extrinsic (allergic or atopic) asthma starts in childhood or early adult life, is triggered by allergens such as dust mites, pollen and animal dander, and is often accompanied by eczema, hay fever or food allergy. Triggering by respiratory infections (A) is typical of intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma. Attacks becoming more severe and frequent with age (B) is also a feature of intrinsic asthma, which starts later in adult life.

      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Fine hand tremors and a fast pulse (B) is correct because salbutamol is a beta-2 agonist that also stimulates beta receptors in skeletal muscle and, to a lesser degree, the heart, so tremor, tachycardia and palpitations are common and the nurse checks the pulse before and after the dose. Bradycardia and drowsiness (A) are the opposite of the expected effect. A fall in body temperature (C) is not a known effect.
