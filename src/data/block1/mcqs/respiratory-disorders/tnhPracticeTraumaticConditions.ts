      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Any trauma to the chest, which may be blunt or penetrating (D) is correct because chest trauma refers to any injury to the chest, and it is classified as blunt or penetrating depending on how the chest wall is injured. An injury to the chest caused only by gunshot or stab wounds (A) is incorrect because this describes penetrating chest trauma only, whereas chest trauma also includes blunt injuries. Entry of air into the pleural space through a breach of the pleura (B) is incorrect because this describes pneumothorax, which is an outcome of chest injury and not the definition of chest trauma. A collection of blood within the pleural cavity (C) is incorrect because this describes haemothorax, which is an outcome of chest injury and not the definition of chest trauma.",

      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "It is more common than penetrating trauma, and motor vehicle crashes are its most common cause (B) is correct because blunt chest trauma results from sudden compression or positive pressure inflicted on the chest wall, it is more common than penetrating trauma, and motor vehicle crashes are the most common cause. It is less common than penetrating trauma, and gunshot wounds are its main cause (A) is incorrect because gunshot and stab wounds are the most common causes of penetrating trauma, which is the less common type. It results from stab wounds that breach the chest wall and enter the pleural cavity (C) is incorrect because a stab wound breaches the chest wall and therefore causes penetrating trauma, not blunt trauma. It is a rare injury that follows only a spontaneous breach of the visceral pleura (D) is incorrect because blunt chest trauma is common, and a spontaneous breach of the pleura is associated with simple (spontaneous) pneumothorax.",

Hypercalcaemia, polycythaemia or hepatic failure (B) is incorrect because these are not the pathologic states produced by blunt chest injury, which causes impaired oxygenation, blood loss and cardiac compromise. Hypernatraemia, hyperglycaemia or renal failure (C) is incorrect because these are not the pathologic states produced by blunt chest injury; the lecture notes list hypoxaemia, hypovolaemia and cardiac failure.

      explanation: "Electrocardiogram (ECG) (C) is correct because an ECG is done to detect possible cardiac injury caused by the impact of blunt chest trauma. Complete blood count (A) is incorrect because a complete blood count assesses the blood cells and helps to detect blood loss, but it does not detect cardiac injury. Arterial blood gas analysis (B) is incorrect because blood gas analysis assesses oxygenation, ventilation and acid-base balance, not cardiac injury. Oxygen saturation monitoring (D) is incorrect because oxygen saturation shows how well the blood is oxygenated and does not show injury to the heart.",

The first through third ribs (A) is incorrect because fractures of the first three ribs are rare, but they carry a high mortality rate because of laceration of the subclavian artery or vein. The tenth through twelfth ribs (B) is incorrect because fractures of the lower ribs are associated with injury to the spleen and liver, but they are not the most common sites.

Injury to the spleen and the liver (A) is incorrect because injury to the spleen and liver is associated with fractures of the lower ribs. Formation of a free-floating chest wall segment (C) is incorrect because a free-floating segment forms in flail chest, when three or more adjacent ribs are fractured at two or more sites. Entry of air into the pleural space under pressure (D) is incorrect because air entering the pleural space under pressure is tension pneumothorax, which is not the reason for the high mortality of upper rib fractures.",

Subclavian artery and vein (A) is incorrect because laceration of the subclavian artery or vein is associated with fractures of the first three ribs. Heart and great vessels (B) is incorrect because wounds of the heart and great vessels are a concern in penetrating trauma, and they are not the injuries linked with lower rib fractures.

Gunshot wounds, when a bullet penetrates the front of the chest (B) is incorrect because gunshot wounds cause penetrating trauma, whereas sternal fractures are typically caused by a direct blunt blow. Prolonged coughing in patients with long-standing lung disease (C) is incorrect because sternal fractures are not typically caused by coughing but by a direct blow to the sternum. Chest tube insertion into the pleural space of a stable patient (D) is incorrect because chest tube insertion is a treatment for pneumothorax and haemothorax and is not the usual cause of sternal fracture.",

A sucking sound at the chest wall, with mediastinal flutter and respiratory distress (A) is incorrect because a sucking sound and mediastinal flutter are features of open pneumothorax. Air hunger, hypotension, cyanosis and marked tachycardia from air trapped under pressure (B) is incorrect because these are acute features of tension pneumothorax.

Tidaling (B) is incorrect because tidaling is the rise and fall of the water in the water-seal chamber of a chest drainage system with breathing. Mediastinal flutter (C) is incorrect because mediastinal flutter is the shift of the heart and great vessels with each breath in open pneumothorax.

      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Three or more adjacent ribs are fractured at two or more sites, leaving a free-floating, unstable segment (A) is correct because flail chest usually occurs when multiple contiguous ribs are fractured at two or more sites, so that a segment of the chest wall is detached and unstable; it is an emergency condition. Three or more adjacent ribs are fractured at a single site only (B) is incorrect because a fracture at only one site does not detach a segment, and flail chest needs fractures at two or more sites. The sternum is fractured by a direct blow from the steering wheel (C) is incorrect because this describes a sternal fracture, which is not the same as the detached rib segment of flail chest.

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Retained airway secretions and atelectasis (C) is correct because retained airway secretions and atelectasis frequently accompany flail chest because the impaired chest wall movement makes it hard to cough and expand the lung. Bronchospasm and wheezing from airway hyperresponsiveness (A) is incorrect because these are features of asthma and are not the problems listed with flail chest. Pleural effusion and empyema (B) is incorrect because these are indications for chest tube insertion and are not listed as frequent accompaniments of flail chest.

A sucking sound at the wound, mediastinal flutter, pain and tachypnoea (A) is incorrect because these are features of open pneumothorax. Tachycardia, hypotension, air hunger and cyanosis from air under pressure (B) is incorrect because these are features of tension pneumothorax.

      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Keep the tubing as straight as possible and loosely placed with no loops, and keep the system below chest level (B) is correct because the tubing is kept as straight as possible, loosely placed below chest level, the patient must not lie on the tubing, there should be no loops, and the drainage system is never elevated above the level of the chest. Coil the tubing on the bed and raise the system above chest level when the patient walks (A) is incorrect because loops obstruct drainage, and the system must never be raised above chest level.

Fall with inhalation and rise with exhalation, which is called tidaling (A) is incorrect because the movement is the other way round, because the water rises with inhalation and falls with exhalation.

Discourage deep breathing and keep the arm still to protect the tube (A) is incorrect because deep breathing and shoulder movement are encouraged, and keeping the arm still can cause shoulder disuse.

Leave the tube open to the air and lay it on the bed (B) is incorrect because an open tube would let outside air enter the pleural space.

Routinely, whenever the patient walks or moves to a chair (B) is incorrect because routine clamping can trap air or fluid in the pleural space, and tubes are clamped only for special procedures.

      explanation: "Fluid drainage has ceased and the lung has re-expanded (D) is correct because the indications for removal of a chest tube are that fluid drainage has ceased and the lung has re-expanded. Continuous bubbling persists in the water-seal chamber (A) is incorrect because continuous bubbling may indicate an air leak, which means the tube is still needed. Drainage is increasing and the lung is still collapsed (B) is incorrect because increasing drainage and a collapsed lung mean that the tube is still needed.
