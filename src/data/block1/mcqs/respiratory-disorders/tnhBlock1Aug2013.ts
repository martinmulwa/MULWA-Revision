      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Tidal volume (A) is correct because it is the volume of air moved in and out with each quiet breath, about 500 mL in a resting adult. Residual volume (B) is incorrect because it is the air that stays in the lungs after a maximal expiration and cannot be breathed out. Inspiratory reserve volume (C) is incorrect because it is the extra air that can be breathed in after a normal inspiration. Expiratory reserve volume (D) is incorrect because it is the extra air that can be forced out after a normal expiration.",

        D: "Hypoxic drive is needed for breathing"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Hypoxic drive is needed for breathing (D) is correct because in chronic COPD with carbon dioxide retention the respiratory centre becomes insensitive to high carbon dioxide, so a low oxygen level is the main stimulus to breathe. High-flow oxygen removes this stimulus and can cause hypoventilation and carbon dioxide narcosis, which is why controlled low-flow oxygen is given (target saturation about 88 to 92%). Severe headache (A) is incorrect because it is not the reason for the restriction. Hypercapnic drive (B) is incorrect because in these patients the drive from raised carbon dioxide is blunted, which is why they rely on hypoxic drive. Higher levels required later (C) is incorrect because patients do not develop such a tolerance to oxygen.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Pneumothorax (C) is correct because air trapped under pressure in the pleural space, as in tension pneumothorax, pushes the mediastinum and trachea away from the affected side. Hyperventilation (A) is incorrect because it changes the breathing pattern but exerts no pressure on the mediastinum. Pneumonia (B) is incorrect because consolidation does not usually displace the trachea. Pleurisy (D) is incorrect because inflamed pleura cause pain and a friction rub, without a mass effect.",

      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Pneumonia (D) is correct because consolidated lung is solid and carries voice vibrations to the chest wall better, so fremitus increases. Emphysema (A) is incorrect because hyperinflated, air-filled lungs dampen vibrations and fremitus decreases. Pneumothorax (B) is incorrect because air in the pleural space blocks vibrations, so fremitus is reduced or absent. Pleurisy (C) is incorrect because inflamed pleura cause pain and a friction rub, and fremitus is not increased.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "It is required that the patient is kept NPO for 6-12 hours before the procedure (A) is correct because an empty stomach reduces the risk of aspiration while sedation and local anaesthesia suppress the protective reflexes (many protocols use about 6 to 8 hours). Anaesthesia not routinely used (B) is incorrect because topical local anaesthetic such as lidocaine is routinely sprayed, often with sedation. Feeding soon after (C) is incorrect because the throat remains numb for hours, so oral intake waits until the gag reflex returns. Oxygen delayed until the gag reflex returns (D) is incorrect because oxygen is given when needed and is not withheld.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Chronic episodic disease (B) is correct because asthma is a long-term airway inflammation with episodes of wheeze, cough and breathlessness triggered by allergens, infection, exercise or cold air, between which the patient may be well. Chronic continuous disease (A) is incorrect because symptoms are intermittent. Irreversible airflow limitation (C) is incorrect because airflow limitation in asthma is largely reversible, unlike COPD. Vasoconstriction (D) is incorrect because the problem is bronchoconstriction, mucosal swelling and mucus, not constriction of blood vessels.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Bronchiectasis (B) is correct because it is permanent, abnormal widening of the bronchi with damaged walls, causing chronic cough and copious foul-smelling sputum. Emphysema (A) is incorrect because it is destruction of the alveolar walls beyond the terminal bronchioles. Chronic bronchitis (C) is incorrect because it is mucus hypersecretion with inflamed, narrowed airways. Empyema (D) is incorrect because it is a collection of pus in the pleural space.",

        D: "Stop the flow of air into chest wall"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Stop the flow of air into chest wall (D) is correct because a sucking chest wound lets air enter the pleural space with every breath, so it is sealed immediately with a sterile occlusive dressing, usually taped on three sides to act as a one-way valve. Oxygen 5 L/min (A) is incorrect because it is needed but does not stop the air entering. Checking for cervical spine fracture (B) is incorrect because it is part of trauma assessment but not the immediate fix for the wound. Underwater seal drainage (C) is incorrect because it follows once the wound is sealed.",

        D: "Is common in penetrating chest trauma"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Is associated with paradoxical chest movements (B) is correct because the free segment moves inward on inspiration and outward on expiration, opposite to the rest of the chest wall. Not affecting ventilation (A) is incorrect because it markedly impairs ventilation, usually with underlying lung contusion. One broken rib (C) is incorrect because flail chest needs several adjacent ribs broken in more than one place. Common in penetrating trauma (D) is incorrect because it typically follows blunt trauma such as road traffic accidents.",

        D: "Reduce respirations and control pain"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Reduce anxiety and control pain (A) is correct because a small intravenous dose relieves the fear and the sensation of breathlessness, which lowers sympathetic drive and oxygen demand; it also dilates veins and lowers preload. Sedating the patient (B) is incorrect because sedation is not the aim and risks respiratory depression. Reducing pulmonary perfusion (C) is incorrect because morphine lowers venous return and pulmonary congestion rather than perfusion, and this is not the classic textbook rationale. Reducing respirations (D) is incorrect because slowing breathing is an adverse effect to monitor. Current evidence questions the routine use of morphine in acute pulmonary oedema.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Gas exchange between alveolar air and blood in the pulmonary capillaries (C) is correct because external respiration is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the respiratory membrane in the lungs, which loads oxygen onto the blood and removes carbon dioxide from it. Use of oxygen inside the cell's mitochondria to release energy from glucose (A) is incorrect because that is cellular respiration, a metabolic process inside cells. Movement of air into and out of the lungs by the respiratory muscles and airways (B) is incorrect because that describes pulmonary ventilation, which only delivers fresh air to the alveoli and is not itself the exchange of gases with the blood. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between systemic capillary blood and the body's tissue cells (D) is incorrect because that is internal respiration, which takes place in the tissues and not in the lungs.",

        D: "By osmosis driven by differences in water concentration between alveoli and blood"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "By simple diffusion down their partial pressure gradients, using no energy (A) is correct because both gases are small, lipid-soluble molecules that move passively from the side with the higher partial pressure to the side with the lower partial pressure, so no cellular energy is needed. By filtration under the hydrostatic pressure of the pulmonary capillaries (B) is incorrect because filtration moves fluid out of capillaries and would cause pulmonary oedema rather than normal gas exchange. By active transport using ATP-driven carrier pumps in the alveolar wall (C) is incorrect because gas exchange does not need energy-consuming pumps; the gradients alone drive movement. By osmosis driven by differences in water concentration between alveoli and blood (D) is incorrect because osmosis describes the movement of water across a membrane, not of respiratory gases.",

        D: "It diffuses from the blood into the alveoli and is then breathed out of the body"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "It diffuses from the alveoli into the blood and binds to haemoglobin (B) is correct because the gradient of roughly 64 mmHg drives oxygen from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillary blood, where most of it binds to haemoglobin in red cells. It remains in the alveoli because the pressure difference is too small to cause movement (A) is incorrect because a 64 mmHg difference is large, so oxygen moves readily. It is pumped into the blood by alveolar cells working against its gradient (C) is incorrect because oxygen crosses passively and needs no pumping. It diffuses from the blood into the alveoli and is then breathed out of the body (D) is incorrect because this is the direction of carbon dioxide movement; oxygen moves down its own gradient, which points into the blood.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be breathed out (A) is correct because carbon dioxide moves from the higher pressure in the blood to the lower pressure in the alveoli; although the gradient is only about 5 mmHg, carbon dioxide is far more soluble than oxygen and diffuses very readily. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by alveolar cells and stored there until exhalation (B) is incorrect because alveolar cells do not store the gas; it passes through the membrane into the alveolar air. Carbon dioxide diffuses from the alveoli into the blood to be carried to the tissues (C) is incorrect because this reverses the gradient; carbon dioxide is a waste gas that leaves the blood in the lungs. No carbon dioxide moves because a 5 mmHg gradient is too small to drive diffusion (D) is incorrect because carbon dioxide is about twenty times more diffusible than oxygen, so a small gradient is enough.",

      explanation: "Fluid lengthens the diffusion distance across the membrane (D) is correct because diffusion slows as the distance increases, so a fluid layer between air and blood reduces oxygen transfer and causes hypoxaemia. Fluid thins the alveolar wall so oxygen is lost from the blood (A) is incorrect because fluid thickens the diffusion path; it does not thin the wall or pull oxygen out of the blood. Fluid increases the surface area available for gas exchange (B) is incorrect because fluid-filled alveoli no longer take part in gas exchange, so the usable surface area falls.

A diet that is low in fibre over many years (A) is incorrect because low fibre is mainly associated with colorectal cancer. A sedentary lifestyle during working years (B) is incorrect because inactivity is not a recognised major cause of lung cancer.

      explanation: "Fluids thin secretions and replace losses from fever and fast breathing (D) is correct because fever and rapid breathing increase fluid loss, and adequate hydration makes the sputum thinner and easier to cough up. Fluids make the patient pass more urine so that bacteria leave the lungs (A) is incorrect because bacteria in the lungs are not excreted in the urine. Fluids dilute the antibiotic so that it works faster (B) is incorrect because fluids do not change how antibiotics act on the infection.

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "The cilia are damaged and can no longer sweep mucus upwards (A) is correct because smoke and inflammation damage and reduce the cilia, so excess mucus pools in the airways, blocks small airways and encourages repeated infection. The mucus becomes too watery to be moved by the cilia (B) is incorrect because the mucus is usually thick, not watery. The bronchial smooth muscle relaxes and stops propelling mucus (C) is incorrect because mucus is moved by cilia and not by smooth muscle. Alveolar macrophages absorb the mucus and store it (D) is incorrect because macrophages engulf particles and do not remove large volumes of mucus.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Narrowed, mucus-plugged airways leave alveoli poorly ventilated yet still perfused (D) is correct because this ventilation-perfusion mismatch prevents proper oxygenation, and in severe disease carbon dioxide also builds up. Haemoglobin loses its ability to bind oxygen as blood passes through the lung capillaries (A) is incorrect because the haemoglobin itself is normal. Pleural fluid builds up and compresses the whole lung from the outside (B) is incorrect because pleural effusion is not the cause here. The alveolar walls are destroyed, which greatly reduces the surface area for exchange (C) is incorrect because this describes emphysema, not the main mechanism in bronchitis.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Stop smoking completely and avoid smoke and fumes (C) is correct because smoking is the main cause of COPD, and stopping it slows lung function decline and reduces exacerbations, as does avoiding smoke from cooking fires. Take a cough suppressant every night (A) is incorrect because this hides symptoms and does not slow the disease. Use oxygen continuously at home whether or not it is prescribed (B) is incorrect because oxygen is prescribed only when indicated.
