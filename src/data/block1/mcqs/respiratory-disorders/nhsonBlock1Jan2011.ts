        D: "Sputum for testing"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Fluid from pleural space (C) is correct because thoracentesis is the passing of a needle through the chest wall to aspirate fluid from the pleural space, either to find the cause of an effusion (diagnostic) or to relieve breathlessness (therapeutic). Pus from the lungs (A) is incorrect because pus inside the lung is cleared by postural drainage, bronchoscopy or surgery, while pus in the pleural space is drained by a chest tube. Blood from lungs (B) is incorrect because blood coming up from the lungs is haemoptysis, which is not removed by a needle. Sputum for testing (D) is incorrect because sputum is coughed up or suctioned from the airways and is not taken from the pleural space.",

        D: "Pleural effusion"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Haemothorax (A) is correct because 'haemo' means blood, so haemothorax is blood in the pleural cavity, usually after chest trauma or chest surgery. Pneumothorax (B) is incorrect because it is air in the pleural cavity. Pyelomothorax (C) is incorrect because it is not a recognised medical term (the nearest real term is pyothorax, meaning pus in the pleural cavity, also called empyema). Pleural effusion (D) is incorrect because it is a general term for excess fluid in the pleural space, which may be clear, bloody or purulent, so it is less specific than haemothorax.",

        D: "Mucolytic agents, antihistamines"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Bronchodilators, mucolytic agents (A) is correct because bronchiectasis involves thick, retained secretions in widened airways: mucolytics thin the mucus and bronchodilators open the airways and help clearance, usually together with antibiotics for infective flare-ups and airway clearance techniques such as postural drainage. Expectorants, antihistamines (B) is incorrect because antihistamines dry and thicken secretions and expectorants are not the main treatment. Antibiotics, antitussive (C) is incorrect because, although antibiotics are used for infection, an antitussive suppresses the cough that the patient needs to clear secretions. Mucolytic agents, antihistamines (D) is incorrect because the antihistamine makes secretions thicker and harder to clear.",

      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Streptococcus pneumoniae (B) is correct because the pneumococcus is the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Klebsiella pneumoniae (A) is incorrect because it is less common and mainly affects alcoholics, diabetics and hospitalised patients. Streptococcus pyogenes (C) is incorrect because it mostly causes throat and skin infections and only rarely pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (D) is incorrect because it causes 'atypical' pneumonia, mainly in younger people, and is not the commonest bacterial cause.",

        D: "Lying on the operative side"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Lying on the operative side (D) is correct because after pneumonectomy the patient is positioned on the operative side or on the back, which protects the single remaining lung and helps prevent the mediastinum (the structures between the lungs) from shifting. Lying on the un-operated side (A) is incorrect because it can let the mediastinum shift towards the empty side and compress the only remaining lung. Strictly on bed (B) is incorrect because strict bed rest raises the risk of chest infection and clots, so careful early mobilisation is encouraged. In a low-lying position (C) is incorrect because lying flat or low restricts lung expansion; a semi-upright position within the surgeon's instructions is preferred.",

        D: "Haemothorax, acute bronchitis"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Bronchiectasis, emphysema (A) is the best answer because postural drainage uses gravity to move retained secretions from lung segments into the large airways to be coughed up; bronchiectasis is a classic indication, and chronic lung disease with copious secretions such as emphysema/chronic bronchitis is also managed with chest physiotherapy. Lung abscess, lung cancer (B) is incorrect because, although postural drainage helps a lung abscess, it is not part of managing lung cancer, so the pair is not fully correct. Bronchial asthma, pleurisy (C) is incorrect because neither condition is marked by retained secretions that gravity drainage would clear, and pleurisy makes positioning and percussion painful. Haemothorax, acute bronchitis (D) is incorrect because blood in the pleural space needs a chest drain, not postural drainage.",

        A: "True",
        B: "False"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "TRUE. In patients with long-standing COPD who retain carbon dioxide, breathing may depend partly on a low oxygen level. Uncontrolled high-concentration oxygen can reduce that drive and cause hypoventilation, a rising carbon dioxide level and drowsiness. Oxygen is therefore given in a controlled, low concentration (for example by nasal prongs at 1 to 2 L/min or a Venturi mask) to keep the saturation at about 88 to 92 percent. Oxygen is never withheld from a hypoxaemic patient; it is titrated carefully.",

        A: "True",
        B: "False"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "FALSE. Tidaling (the water level in the water-seal tube rising and falling with breathing) is the sign that the system is working. Continuous bubbling in the water-seal chamber means air is entering the system, either from a leak in the tubing or connections or from an air leak from the lung, and it must be checked. Small intermittent bubbles on expiration or coughing can be normal while a pneumothorax is still resolving, but bubbling is not the sign of a functioning drain.",

        D: "Educate patient on breathing exercises"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Assess oxygen saturation (B) is correct because pleural fluid compresses the lung and reduces ventilation, so airway, breathing and oxygenation come first: the nurse checks the saturation, respiratory rate and work of breathing and gives oxygen as prescribed. Relieve pain (A) is incorrect because pain matters but does not take priority over oxygenation. Clear secretion in the airway (C) is incorrect because the problem is fluid outside the lung and not retained secretions in the airway. Educate patient on breathing exercises (D) is incorrect because teaching is done once the patient is stable.",

        D: "The lung volume increases"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Atmospheric pressure is lower than intrapulmonary pressure (A) is correct because in quiet expiration the diaphragm relaxes and rises and the chest wall and lungs recoil, so lung volume falls and the pressure inside the lungs rises just above atmospheric pressure, pushing air out. Rib cage moves upwards and outwards (B) is incorrect because that happens during inspiration; in expiration the rib cage moves downwards and inwards. The diaphragm flattens (C) is incorrect because it flattens in inspiration and domes upwards in expiration. The lung volume increases (D) is incorrect because lung volume increases in inspiration and decreases in expiration.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Accumulation of thick, purulent fluid in pleural space (B) is correct because empyema is pus in the pleural space, most often a complication of pneumonia or a lung abscess. Localized collection of fluid in the lungs (A) is incorrect because that is closer to a lung abscess or localised consolidation inside the lung tissue, not the pleural space. Pathological distension of air spaces of the lungs (C) is incorrect because that describes emphysema. Inflammation of pleural membrane (D) is incorrect because that describes pleurisy (pleuritis).",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Bound to haemoglobin as oxyhaemoglobin (C) is correct because oxygen dissolves poorly in water, so about 97 percent of it is carried loosely attached to the iron of haemoglobin inside red blood cells, which is what allows enough oxygen to reach the tissues. Dissolved freely in the plasma as oxygen gas (A) is incorrect because only about 2 percent of oxygen travels dissolved in plasma because oxygen is poorly soluble. Converted to bicarbonate and carried in the plasma (B) is incorrect because bicarbonate is the main carrier of carbon dioxide, not oxygen. Attached to platelets and white blood cells (D) is incorrect because platelets and white blood cells work in clotting and defence and do not carry oxygen.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "About 2 percent (D) is correct because oxygen is poorly soluble, so only a tiny amount (about 0.3 mL per 100 mL of blood at a normal PaO2) is dissolved; although small, this is the portion that actually diffuses into the tissue cells. About 20 percent (A) is incorrect because 20 percent is closer to the share of carbon dioxide carried as carbaminohaemoglobin. About 50 percent (B) is incorrect because 50 percent is far too high because haemoglobin carries nearly all of the oxygen. About 70 percent (C) is incorrect because 70 percent is the share of carbon dioxide carried as bicarbonate, not the share of oxygen dissolved in plasma.",

      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Bicarbonate ions in the plasma (B) is correct because about 70 percent of carbon dioxide is converted inside red blood cells to carbonic acid and then to bicarbonate, which diffuses out into the plasma. Dissolved carbon dioxide gas in the plasma (A) is incorrect because only about 7 percent is carried dissolved, so this is the smallest of the three real forms. Carbaminohaemoglobin in red blood cells (C) is incorrect because carbaminohaemoglobin carries about 20 to 23 percent, which is the second largest share. Carboxyhaemoglobin in red blood cells (D) is incorrect because carboxyhaemoglobin is haemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide and has nothing to do with carbon dioxide transport.",

      explanation: "Carbaminohaemoglobin (carbon dioxide on globin) (C) is correct because carbon dioxide does not bind to the iron as oxygen does; it attaches to amino groups on the globin chains, forming a reversible compound that carries roughly 20 percent of the carbon dioxide and releases it in the lungs. Carboxyhaemoglobin (carbon monoxide on haem iron) (A) is incorrect because carboxyhaemoglobin forms when carbon monoxide binds to the haem iron and it blocks oxygen carriage. Oxyhaemoglobin (oxygen on haem iron) (B) is incorrect because oxyhaemoglobin is haemoglobin carrying oxygen on its iron, not carbon dioxide. Methaemoglobin (haemoglobin with oxidised iron) (D) is incorrect because methaemoglobin forms when the iron is oxidised to the ferric state and it cannot carry oxygen.",

The alveolar walls become too thick for gas to diffuse across (B) is incorrect because surfactant does not control wall thickness, and thick walls would impair diffusion but would not make the alveoli collapse. Thick mucus plugs block every small airway at the same time (C) is incorrect because mucus plugging is the cause of obstructive atelectasis and not of surfactant deficiency.

      explanation: "Record the amount, colour and consistency regularly (B) is correct because the amount, colour and consistency of drainage show whether bleeding or infection is developing, and a sudden rise in bright red drainage must be reported to the doctor immediately. Estimate the volume once at the end of the shift (A) is incorrect because a single estimate at the end of a shift could miss sudden bleeding. Empty the bottle each hour without measuring the fluid (C) is incorrect because emptying the bottle without measuring loses the record needed to see a trend. Record only the colour because the volume is not important (D) is incorrect because volume is essential because a sudden increase can signal bleeding.",

Only once a week during the consultant's ward round (B) is incorrect because a week is too long between checks and a soiled dressing would stay in place.

Complete a detailed history of her usual triggers (A) is incorrect because a history is important but is taken after she is stable.

Lying flat on her back with one pillow (A) is incorrect because lying flat lets the abdominal contents press on the diaphragm and increases breathlessness. Lying head-down with the foot of the bed raised (C) is incorrect because a head-down position pushes the abdominal organs against the diaphragm and makes breathing harder.

It relaxes the bronchial muscle within a few seconds (A) is incorrect because rapid muscle relaxation is the action of salbutamol and not of corticosteroids. It dries the bronchial secretions to stop the wheeze (B) is incorrect because corticosteroids do not dry secretions, and drying them would make mucus plugs worse.
