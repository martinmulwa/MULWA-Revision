        C: "The left lung has three lobes",
        D: "Surfactant raises the surface tension of alveolar fluid"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Type II alveolar cells are fewer compared to type I (B) is the best answer: type I cells are thin, flat cells that line about 95% of the alveolar surface and form the gas-exchange barrier, while the small cuboidal type II cells cover only about 5% of it, so they are the smaller part of the lining. (Strictly, type II cells are more numerous by cell count, but type I cells cover far more surface, which is the sense in which this statement is taught.) Type I alveolar cells secrete surfactant (A) is incorrect because surfactant is made and secreted by type II cells. The left lung has three lobes (C) is incorrect because the left lung has two lobes (upper and lower), leaving room for the heart; the right lung has three. Surfactant raises the surface tension of alveolar fluid (D) is incorrect because surfactant lowers surface tension, which stops the alveoli from collapsing at the end of expiration.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Crackles (D) is correct because crackles are short, popping or bubbling sounds, heard mainly on inspiration, made when fluid-filled or collapsed small airways and alveoli pop open; they are typical of pulmonary oedema, pneumonia and fibrosis. Stridor (A) is a harsh, high-pitched sound on inspiration caused by upper-airway obstruction. Wheezing (B) is a continuous, high-pitched whistling sound from narrowed small airways, typical of asthma. Rhonchi (C) are low-pitched, snoring continuous sounds from secretions in the larger airways and often clear after coughing.",

      options: {
        A: "Respiratory alkalosis",
        B: "Metabolic alkalosis",
        C: "Respiratory acidosis",
        D: "Metabolic acidosis"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Respiratory acidosis (C) is correct. Step 1: a pH of 7.1 is far below 7.35, so the blood is acidotic. Step 2: PaCO2 of 59 mmHg is above 45 mmHg, so carbon dioxide (an acid) is being retained through hypoventilation, which makes the cause respiratory. Step 3: HCO3 of 26 is at the upper limit of normal (22 to 26), so the kidneys have not yet compensated; this is an acute, uncompensated and severe picture. The PaO2 of 80 mmHg sits at the lower limit of normal (80 to 100) and fits impaired gas exchange in severe pneumonia. Respiratory alkalosis (A) would show a high pH with a low PaCO2. Metabolic alkalosis (B) would show a high pH with a high HCO3. Metabolic acidosis (D) would show a low pH with a low HCO3 and usually a low PaCO2 as the lungs compensate.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Aspiration of fluid from the pleural space (B) is correct because thoracentesis is the passing of a needle through the chest wall into the pleural space to withdraw fluid, either to test it (diagnostic) or to relieve breathlessness (therapeutic). Direct examination of the pleural cavity (A) describes thoracoscopy. Direct visualization of the trachea (C) describes bronchoscopy or tracheoscopy.

        C: "Emphysema",
        D: "Atelectasis"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Pleurisy (A) is correct because pleurisy (pleuritis) is inflammation of the visceral and parietal pleura; the inflamed layers rub together and cause sharp chest pain on breathing, and it commonly accompanies pneumonia. Pleural effusion (B) is an abnormal collection of fluid between the pleural layers, not inflammation of the layers themselves. Emphysema (C) is a chronic disease with destruction of the alveolar walls. Atelectasis (D) is collapse of lung tissue.",

        C: "Community acquired",
        D: "Nosocomial"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Community acquired (C) is correct because hospital-acquired pneumonia is defined as pneumonia that develops 48 hours or more after admission and was not incubating on admission. At 24 hours the infection was most likely already incubating when the patient arrived, so it is classed as community acquired. Hospital acquired (A) and Nosocomial (D) mean the same thing and both require the 48-hour minimum, so neither can be correct. Aspiration (B) requires inhalation of stomach or oral contents, which the question does not describe.",

        C: "Empyema",
        D: "Pulmonary edema"
      },
      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Pulmonary edema (D) is correct because failing kidneys cannot excrete water and sodium; the resulting fluid overload raises pulmonary capillary pressure and forces fluid into the alveoli, causing severe breathlessness and frothy pink sputum. Restricting fluids prevents this. Pleural effusion (A) can occur with fluid overload but develops more slowly and is not the classic immediately life-threatening result. Status asthmaticus (B) is a severe, prolonged asthma attack and is not prevented by fluid restriction. Empyema (C) is a collection of pus in the pleural space caused by infection.",

        C: "Montelukast",
        D: "Cromolyn sodium"
      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Montelukast (C) is correct because it is a leukotriene receptor antagonist; it blocks the leukotrienes that cause bronchoconstriction, mucus and airway swelling and is used for long-term control. Albuterol (A) is a short-acting beta-2 agonist reliever that relaxes bronchial muscle. Beclomethasone (B) is an inhaled corticosteroid that reduces airway inflammation. Cromolyn sodium (D) is a mast cell stabiliser that prevents release of histamine and other mediators.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Stop smoking (C) is correct because smoking is the main cause of COPD and stopping is the single most effective measure to slow the yearly loss of lung function (FEV1). Attend all scheduled chest physiotherapy sessions (A) helps clear secretions but does not slow the decline. Take smaller amounts of food but frequently (B) helps nutrition and reduces breathlessness while eating, but it does not affect lung function loss. Take fluids liberally (D) can thin secretions but does not slow the decline and may be unsuitable if the patient has right-sided heart failure.",

        D: "Air enters the pleural cavity, causing lung collapse"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Three or more adjacent ribs are fractured at two or more sites, resulting in free-floating rib segments (B) is correct because this is the definition most often taught in nursing texts: the free segment is no longer attached to the chest wall and moves paradoxically (inward on inspiration, outward on expiration). Options A and C (one or more adjacent ribs) are incorrect because a single fractured rib cannot form a free-floating segment, and 'several sites' in A is not the standard wording. Air enters the pleural cavity, causing lung collapse (D) describes a pneumothorax. Note: some sources use two or more adjacent ribs; the three-rib definition is the one this option reflects.",

      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Biopsy (A) is correct because only microscopic examination of tissue or cells (histology or cytology) confirms that a lesion is cancer and identifies its type, which decides treatment. Chest x-ray (B) can show a mass but cannot prove it is malignant. CT scan (C) shows the size, position and spread of a lesion and helps staging, but it is not proof of cancer. Thoracoscopy (D) is a way of looking into the pleural space and taking samples; it is the tissue sample, not the viewing, that gives the definitive diagnosis.",

      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Lung cancer (B) is correct because a solid tumour, or the collapse and fluid that often accompany it, replaces air in the lung, so the percussion note over the area is dull. Acute asthma (A), emphysema (C) and COPD (D) all trap air and over-inflate the lungs, which gives a hyperresonant note, not a dull one.

      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Noticeably diminished breath sounds (A) is correct because in a severe, life-threatening attack airflow falls so low that the wheeze fades and breath sounds become faint (the silent chest), warning of impending respiratory failure. Loud wheezing (B) and wheezing on expiration (C) show that air is still moving and are common in an ordinary attack. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (D) is normal; a worsening attack usually brings fast breathing.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Orthopnea (C) is correct because it is breathlessness when lying flat that eases on sitting or standing, since the upright position lets the diaphragm descend and reduces blood return to the lungs; it is common in heart failure and COPD. Bradypnea (A) is an abnormally slow breathing rate (below 12 per minute). Tachypnea (B) is an abnormally fast rate (above 20 per minute).

On the bed beside the hip (A) is unsafe because the bottle can rise to chest level or be tipped when the patient moves. On the bedside locker at chest height (C) gives poor gravity drainage and allows backflow.

      explanation: "To form a one-way valve that stops air re-entering (D) is correct because the water seal lets air and fluid leave the pleural space but stops air being drawn back in on inspiration; this keeps the system closed and airtight, so the water level in the seal chamber must be maintained (about 2 cm). To record the volume of fluid (A) is the job of the graduated collection chamber. To control the suction (B) is the job of the suction control chamber or the wall regulator. To prevent the bottle tipping over (C) is not a function of the water seal; stability comes from keeping the unit upright and secured.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Check the tubing for kinks or clots and report (C) is correct because tidaling (the water level moving with breathing) shows that the drain is open and connected to the pleural space; loss of tidaling with new breathlessness suggests a kink, a dependent loop, a clot or a displaced tube. The nurse traces the tubing from chest to bottle, relieves any kink, assesses breathing and reports at once. Record it as normal (A) is wrong because absent tidaling with worsening breathlessness is not normal; tidaling can stop harmlessly when the lung has fully re-expanded, but not in a patient who is deteriorating. Raising the bottle above the chest (B) lets fluid flow back into the pleural space. Increasing the suction (D) is not a nursing decision and can damage lung tissue.",

The nurse routinely checks respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, breath sounds and chest pain. Water level rising and falling with each breath (A) is normal tidaling and shows the drain is working.

Lying flat with the arm kept still (A) restricts breathing and leads to a stiff shoulder.

The nurse cleans the site with aseptic technique, secures the tube, and looks for redness, pus, swelling and crackling under the skin.

        C: "Their alveoli make too much surfactant",
        D: "Their white blood cells are absent from the airways"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "Stagnant mucus lets bacteria multiply (A) is correct because the thick mucus that is not cleared by the damaged cilia is an ideal place for bacteria to grow, and each infection causes further inflammation and airway damage. Too little mucus (B) is the opposite of the real problem. Too much surfactant (C) is not a feature of the disease. White blood cells absent from the airways (D) is wrong because the airways are full of inflammatory cells, yet they cannot clear the infection.",

        D: "Haemoglobin loses its ability to carry oxygen to tissues"
      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "Poorly ventilated alveoli still receive blood flow (B) is correct because mucus plugs and narrowed airways reduce the air reaching many alveoli while their capillaries keep carrying blood; this ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch means blood leaves the lungs poorly oxygenated and carbon dioxide is not fully removed, causing hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and cyanosis. Blood flow stopping completely (A) is not what happens; the problem is mismatched ventilation. Loss of surfactant (C) is not the cause. Haemoglobin losing its ability to carry oxygen (D) is not part of this disease.",

        A: "True",
        B: "False"
      },
      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "TRUE. Low oxygen in the alveoli makes the small pulmonary arteries constrict, which raises the pressure in the pulmonary circulation (pulmonary hypertension). The right ventricle has to pump against this higher pressure and, over time, enlarges and fails, giving cor pulmonale with ankle swelling and a raised neck vein pressure. Chronic hypoxaemia also stimulates the production of red blood cells (polycythaemia).",
