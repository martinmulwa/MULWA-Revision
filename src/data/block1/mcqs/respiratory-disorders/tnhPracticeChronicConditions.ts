      },
      correctAnswer: "B",
      explanation: "A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes airway hyperresponsiveness, mucosal oedema and mucus production (B) is correct because asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease whose inflammation leads to recurrent episodes of cough, chest tightness, wheezing and dyspnea. A disease with airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible (A) is incorrect because this describes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas asthma is characterised by recurrent episodes of symptoms. An abnormal distention of the airspaces beyond the terminal bronchioles with destruction of the alveolar walls (C) is incorrect because this describes emphysema, in which the alveolar walls are destroyed. A severe and persistent attack that does not respond to conventional therapy (D) is incorrect because this describes status asthmaticus, which is a complication of asthma and not the disease itself.",

Air pollution from burning fossil fuels (A) is incorrect because air pollution from fossil fuels is listed as a risk factor for COPD.

      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Chronic inflammation, which leads to airway hyperresponsiveness and acute airway limitation (D) is correct because exposure to allergens or irritants starts an inflammatory cascade, and the resulting chronic inflammation causes airway hyperresponsiveness and acute airway limitation. Breakdown of elastin with loss of lung elasticity (A) is incorrect because breakdown of elastin is the process that leads to loss of lung elasticity in emphysema. Permanent fibrosis of the airways caused by smoking (B) is incorrect because permanent fibrosis from smoking belongs to chronic bronchitis and COPD, not to the primary process of asthma.

      correctAnswer: "D",
      explanation: "Leukotrienes, histamine, cytokines and prostaglandins (D) is correct because these mediators perpetuate the inflammation, causing increased blood flow, vasoconstriction, increased capillary permeability with oedema, bronchoconstriction and attraction of white blood cells. Haemoglobin and erythropoietin (A) is incorrect because haemoglobin and erythropoietin are not inflammatory mediators released by mast cells. Elastase and other protease enzymes (B) is incorrect because elastase and protease enzymes destroy the alveolar walls in emphysema and COPD. Alpha-1 antitrypsin and surfactant (C) is incorrect because alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a hereditary predisposing factor for emphysema and COPD, and it is not a mast cell mediator.",

      },
      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Expiration, because air squeezes out through narrowed bronchi with increased secretions (C) is correct because breathing in becomes easier while expiration needs more effort because the bronchi are narrowed and secretions are increased, and the air squeezing out produces the wheeze. Both phases equally, because the alveoli are filled with fluid (A) is incorrect because fluid in the alveoli describes pulmonary oedema, and in asthma expiration is the phase that needs more effort. Inspiration, because the bronchi are dilated and secretions are reduced (B) is incorrect because in asthma the bronchi are narrowed and not dilated, and secretions are increased. Neither phase, because wheezing is produced by friction in the pleural space (D) is incorrect because wheezing is produced by air passing through the constricted bronchi and not by the pleura.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "An IgE-mediated allergic reaction, a history of eczema or allergic rhinitis, and recovery with age in many children (C) is correct because patients usually have earlier allergic conditions such as eczema or allergic rhinitis and known allergies to pollens, animals and food; the asthma is IgE mediated, and children with this type usually recover with age, especially in adolescence. Onset in adulthood without a clear external allergic trigger (A) is incorrect because this describes intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma.

      correctAnswer: "A",
      explanation: "It is non-allergic, usually develops in adulthood, and can progress to chronic bronchitis or emphysema (A) is correct because intrinsic asthma occurs without a clear external allergic trigger and is not primarily IgE mediated; it is triggered by pollutants, cold weather, exercise, respiratory infection or drugs such as aspirin.

Degranulation of mast cells with release of histamine (A) is incorrect because mast cell degranulation is part of the asthma inflammatory cascade.

The respiratory muscles are paralysed by hypercapnia (A) is incorrect because paralysis of the respiratory muscles is not the mechanism of air trapping in COPD.

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Symptoms appear slowly over several years, with progressive dyspnea on exertion and later at rest, and can lead to right-sided heart failure (C) is correct because the onset is slow, typically over several years, with dyspnea that is progressive, first on exertion and later also at rest, and the disease can lead to right-sided heart failure. Dyspnea occurs at rest first and improves with exertion (A) is incorrect because dyspnea in emphysema begins on exertion and later occurs at rest. Symptoms appear suddenly within 30 to 60 minutes and resolve completely (B) is incorrect because this describes the time course of an asthmatic inflammatory response. Symptoms start without warning and progress to asphyxiation (D) is incorrect because this describes status asthmaticus.",

      explanation: "Progressive cough with increased sputum, use of accessory muscles, anorexia with weight loss, profound weakness, a dusky colour leading to cyanosis, and clubbing of the fingers (B) is correct because these are the clinical manifestations of emphysema, which develops slowly. Engorged neck veins, prolonged exhalation and respiratory alkalosis (A) is incorrect because these are features of status asthmaticus.

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "Increased anteroposterior diameter on the chest radiograph, increased PaCO2 with decreased PaO2, and polycythaemia (C) is correct because the chest radiograph shows an increased anteroposterior diameter, blood gases show increased PaCO2 and decreased PaO2, and blood analysis shows polycythaemia, an increase in red blood cells in response to hypoxaemia. Increased interstitial markings on the chest radiograph with a falling PaCO2 (A) is incorrect because increased interstitial markings are a finding in pulmonary oedema, and PaCO2 rises in emphysema. A reduced anteroposterior diameter with a decreased red blood cell count (B) is incorrect because the anteroposterior diameter is increased, and the red cell count rises in response to hypoxaemia. A normal chest radiograph with eosinophilia and a raised IgE (D) is incorrect because eosinophilia and raised IgE are findings in allergic asthma.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      explanation: "A morning cough with sputum, dyspnea, use of accessory muscles, barrel chest, and retraction of the supraclavicular fossae on inspiration (C) is correct because the symptoms develop slowly after years of smoking; the cough usually occurs in the morning, and the patient leans forward and uses the accessory muscles, which causes retraction of the supraclavicular fossae and heaving of the shoulders upward, together with a barrel chest, wheezing and chest tightness. Foamy blood-tinged sputum with air hunger and basal crackles (A) is incorrect because this describes pulmonary oedema. Decreased breath sounds, a dull percussion note and tracheal deviation (B) is incorrect because this describes a pleural effusion. Sudden wheezing, diaphoresis and central cyanosis within 30 to 60 minutes of allergen exposure (D) is incorrect because this describes an allergic asthma attack.",

Immunomodulators to inhibit IgE as the main treatment (A) is incorrect because immunomodulators inhibit IgE in allergic asthma and are not the main treatment of COPD.
