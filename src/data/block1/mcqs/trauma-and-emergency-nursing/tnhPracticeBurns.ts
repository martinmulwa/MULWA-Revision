        "D": "Minor and self-limiting"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Potentially life threatening (A) is correct because even a burn that looks small can cause fluid loss, shock, inhalation injury or infection, and its true depth and extent only become clear after a full assessment (the first estimate of TBSA is revised within 72 hours). Minor and self-limiting (D) is incorrect because severity cannot be assumed before assessment. Limited to the skin, with no systemic effects (C) is incorrect because burns above 20% TBSA produce systemic responses in the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory and pulmonary systems. Superficial in depth (B) is incorrect because depth is judged only after assessment, and demarcation of the wound is clearer after about 72 hours.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "20% (B) is correct because burns not exceeding 20% TBSA produce mainly a local response (oedema and fluid loss at the burn site). Burns that exceed 20% TBSA produce both a local and a systemic response and are considered major burn injuries. 10% (D) and 15% (C) are below the cut-off and are not the threshold used in the notes. 30% (A) is above the cut-off; a burn of 25%, for example, would already be a major burn with systemic effects.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Thermal damage to endothelial cells with increased capillary permeability (D) is correct because heat injury to the vessels damages the endothelial cells, so water, protein and electrolytes escape from the circulating volume into the interstitial space, causing oedema. Inflammatory mediators released by damaged tissue (histamine, prostaglandins, bradykinin) increase this permeability further. Increased albumin production (A) is incorrect because burns cause a loss of protein from the vessels, not a gain. A fall in hydrostatic pressure (C) is incorrect because the problem is leaky vessels, not low pressure. Lymphatic blockage by clots (B) is not the mechanism described; the primary event is increased capillary permeability.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Four times as much (D) is correct because the burned skin has lost its barrier function, so evaporation from denuded areas is four times that from intact skin. This adds to the plasma lost into the interstitial space and contributes to hypovolaemia, low blood pressure and possibly hypovolaemic shock. Twice (B), three times (C) and eight times (A) are not the figures given in the notes.",

      "explanation": "Compartment syndrome (A) is correct because swelling inside a limited space compresses blood vessels and nerves, so blood flow to the distal extremity is obstructed, in the same way as in a compartment syndrome. Cardiac tamponade (D) is compression of the heart by fluid in the pericardial sac. Pulmonary embolism (C) is blockage of a pulmonary artery by an embolus. Paralytic ileus (B) is absence of intestinal peristalsis, a gastrointestinal complication of burns, and has nothing to do with limb perfusion.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Slowing of blood flow in the small vessels, causing tissue hypoxia (A) is correct because loss of plasma raises the haematocrit and the viscosity of the blood, so it flows slowly through the small vessels and the tissues receive less oxygen. Faster flow with hyperperfusion (C) is the opposite of what happens. A fall in haematocrit (D) is incorrect because the haematocrit is increased by haemoconcentration in the early phase. Reduced capillary permeability (B) is incorrect because permeability is increased after a burn, and it only returns to normal as the capillaries regain their integrity.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Plasma loss into the interstitial space, fall in circulating volume, fall in cardiac output and blood pressure, then reduced perfusion and oxygen delivery (C) is correct because damaged capillaries leak plasma, the circulating volume falls rapidly, cardiac output and blood pressure drop, and perfusion and oxygen delivery decrease; this is the onset of burn shock. Prompt fluid resuscitation maintains the blood pressure in the low to normal range and improves cardiac output. Fluid retention with hypertension (B) is the opposite of what occurs. Vasodilation with bradycardia (D) is incorrect because the sympathetic response causes vasoconstriction and tachycardia. Increased red cell production (A) is incorrect because red cells are destroyed or damaged at the time of the burn, not overproduced.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis (B) is correct because sodium leaks from the blood vessels into the interstitial space with the oedema (hyponatraemia), potassium is released rapidly and massively from damaged cells into the bloodstream (hyperkalaemia), and the build-up of toxins and renal impairment cause metabolic acidosis. Options A and D are incorrect because they list hypernatraemia, which is not expected; sodium is lost from the circulation. Options C and D are incorrect because they list hypokalaemia, whereas potassium is raised by cell destruction. Options A and C are incorrect because alkalosis and respiratory acidosis are not the expected acid-base disturbance.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "6 to 8 hours (A) is correct because the leak of fluid, protein and electrolytes into the interstitial space is greatest in the first 24 to 36 hours after the burn and peaks by 6 to 8 hours. After this the capillaries begin to regain their integrity, burn shock resolves and fluid returns to the vascular compartment. 1 to 2 hours (D) is too early to be the peak. 12 to 16 hours (C) is past the peak. 48 to 72 hours (B) is beyond the period of greatest leak; by 24 to 48 hours fluid remobilisation has begun.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Decreased peristalsis and bowel sounds, gastric distension, nausea and vomiting (C) is correct because paralytic ileus is absence of intestinal peristalsis, caused by hypoperfusion, inflammatory responses and stress-related mucosal injury, and gastric decompression is started. Occult blood and coffee-ground vomitus (B) are the signs of Curling's ulcer, the other gastrointestinal complication. Hyperactive bowel sounds with diarrhoea (A) is the opposite of the absent peristalsis seen in ileus. Visible peristalsis with fresh blood (D) is not a feature of burn-induced ileus.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Curling's ulcer (D) is correct because it is a duodenal erosion that occurs within 24 hours of a burn, and its signs are gastric bleeding: occult blood in the stool, regurgitation of 'coffee ground' material or bloody vomitus. Paralytic ileus (B) presents with decreased bowel sounds, gastric distension, nausea and vomiting. Acute tubular necrosis (A) is a renal complication seen with haemoglobin and myoglobin in the tubules. Compartment syndrome (C) is a vascular and nerve compression problem of an extremity.",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, mucoprotectants and early enteral nutrition (C) is correct because these decrease gastric acid secretion, protect the mucosa, and restore mucosal blood flow while stimulating prostaglandins. NSAIDs and corticosteroids (A) damage the gastric mucosa and delayed feeding does not restore its blood flow. Antiemetics, laxatives and nil by mouth (B) do not protect the mucosa. Anticoagulants (D) increase the risk of bleeding and diuretics reduce the circulating volume, so neither prevents the ulcer.",

      "explanation": "Loss of skin leads to an inability to regulate body temperature, with heat lost through evaporation (D) is correct because the skin is the organ that conserves heat, so patients with burn injuries may have low body temperatures early on. For this reason burn centres use heat panels at the bedside and additional heating sources. Increased heat production (A) would raise the temperature, not lower it. Destruction of the hypothalamus (C) is not the cause. Excessive sweating (B) is incorrect because burned skin has lost its sweat glands and the heat loss is by evaporation from the denuded surface.",

Because of the risk of airway oedema, early nasotracheal or endotracheal intubation is done.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "72 hours (C) is correct because by this time demarcation of the wound and its depth present themselves more clearly, so the estimate is revised. The TBSA estimate helps the burn team decide on treatment and on transfer of the patient to a burn centre. 6 hours (B) and 12 hours (A) are too early for the wound to have demarcated. 7 days (D) is later than the period stated for revising the initial evaluation.",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Head and neck 9%, each lower extremity 18%, genitalia (perineum) 1% (B) is correct because the rule of nines divides the adult body into head and neck 9%, each upper extremity 9%, each lower extremity 18%, anterior trunk 18%, posterior trunk 18% and genitalia 1%, which totals 100%. Head and neck 18% with legs 9% (A) swaps the values. Each arm 18% and anterior trunk 9% (C) also swaps the values. Genitalia 9% (D) is incorrect because the perineum is 1%.",

The method is used for scattered or small burns and for quick pre-hospital assessment, but it can be inaccurate: it may overestimate in adults and underestimate burn size in obese patients. 0.5% (B) is the palm without the fingers. 5% (C) and 9% (D) are far larger than the palm; 9% is the value for the head and neck or one arm in the rule of nines.",
