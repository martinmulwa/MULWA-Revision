        "D": "Deeper tissues and blood vessels are damaged, so blood is not seen on the skin's surface"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Deeper tissues and blood vessels are damaged, so blood is not seen on the skin's surface (D) is correct because internal bleeding results from damage to deeper tissues and vessels, while external bleeding is the one where blood is visible on the skin's surface. Blood visible on the skin (A) describes external bleeding. A small loss of blood from a minor wound (B) describes mild bleeding. A large loss with likely shock (C) describes severe bleeding, which can be either external or internal.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Severe bleeding (A) is correct because, when a lot of blood is lost, the patient is likely to go into shock. Mild bleeding (B) is where little blood is lost. Moderate bleeding (C) is where more blood is lost, but less than in severe bleeding. Internal bleeding only (D) is incorrect because severity is graded separately from whether the blood is visible (external) or hidden (internal).",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Call emergency services immediately (C) is correct because if the bleeding is severe or the wound is large, emergency help is called at once; direct pressure is then applied while waiting. Applying a tourniquet (A) is done later and only if the rescuer is trained and direct pressure fails on a limb. Removing the soaked dressing (B) is incorrect because dressings are not removed.

      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Apply firm, direct pressure on the wound with a clean cloth or dressing (D) is correct because direct pressure is the main step that helps to stop the bleeding. Repeated washing (A) would wash away forming clots and does not control bleeding. Leaving the wound uncovered (B) allows continued blood loss and contamination.

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Above the level of the heart, to help reduce blood flow to the area (A) is correct because elevation is used together with direct pressure, if possible. Below the level of the heart (B) would increase the blood flow to the wound. Raising the limb only to the level of the heart (C) does not reduce the flow enough. Raising it only after the tourniquet has been loosened (D) has no basis in the notes, since the tourniquet is a later step.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Apply pressure to a pressure point on a nearby artery (C) is correct because, if direct pressure and elevation fail, pressure is applied to a nearby artery (the pressure point), if the rescuer is trained. Removing the dressing (A) is incorrect because it can disrupt clotting. Giving food (B) is not appropriate for a bleeding patient who may need surgery. The recovery position (D) is used for an unconscious patient who is breathing, not as a way to control bleeding.",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The bleeding is severe, from a limb, and the rescuer is trained; it is applied above the wound (D) is correct because these are the conditions given for using a tourniquet. A nosebleed (A) is managed by leaning forward and pinching the nose. A mild bleed from the trunk (B) cannot be controlled by a tourniquet, and it is not placed over the wound. Use by an untrained rescuer below the wound (C) is incorrect, since it is used only if trained and it is placed above the wound.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Prevent shock (B) is correct because the injured person is reassured and kept warm and calm to prevent shock, and their breathing and level of consciousness are monitored continuously. Stopping the bleeding directly (A) is done by pressure, elevation and, if needed, a tourniquet. Relieving pain completely (C) is not achieved by warmth and reassurance. Preventing infection (D) is done by wound care, not by keeping the person warm.",

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Leave it in place and keep applying pressure, because removing it can disrupt clotting (A) is correct because a dressing already in place is not removed, even if it soaks through. Removing it and replacing it (B), removing it and washing the wound (C), and loosening it (D) would all disturb the clot that is forming and increase bleeding.",
